# data-wrangling-pipelines

The goal of the `data-wrangling-pipelines` project is to utilize the [datapackage-pipelines](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage-pipelines) framework for code reusability and communual learning and improvement to provide the best solutions for common data wrangling problems.

Check out the [available challenges](https://github.com/OriHoch/data-wrangling-pipelines/issues)!

Provide your solutions as pull requests, with the relevant code under a directory named with the number and title of the issue.

If you want to open a dedicated repository for your solution - provide a README.md in your directory linking to the repository.

The solutions should be based on the latest version of the [datapackage-pipelines framework](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage-pipelines) with minimal dependencies.
